## Analytical Artifact v1

`contract/analytical-artifact/v1/` (schema and fixtures) is a test snapshot of insight `contracts/analytical-artifact/v1/` at revision `a90b5d4ae1a63c28f93adb509974dc97b75c9049` (insight `main`, 2026-09-24), identical to the insight-sdk-go copy. `test/analytical.test.ts` validates every pinned fixture.
